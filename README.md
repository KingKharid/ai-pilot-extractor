# ai-pilot-extractor
An AI-steered Python web scraper designed for complex data extraction from dynamic sites.

This project demonstrates an AI Pilot workflow. I used LLM-assisted coding to rapidly prototype the extraction logic, then manually refined the CSS selectors and error-handling to ensure 100% data reliability. This is a primary example of Vibe Coding—steering AI to handle the boilerplate while I enforce technical precision.
